# TypeScript Classes

## Instructions

You are now writing code to manage a small office. In the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/):

1. Create a `Person` class with a few properties, such as `age`, `eyeColor`, `hairColor`, and also an optional property, such as `isEmployed`. Include a constructor function and have it assign all of the class's properties from the constructor's arguments.
2. Create two different instances of the `Person` class.
3. Update the optional property of one of the `Person`s using dot notation.
4. Create a subclass of the `Person`, such as `Doctor`. Ensure the `super()` method is correctly called.
5. Instantiate the subclass of the `Doctor` and log it to the console.
