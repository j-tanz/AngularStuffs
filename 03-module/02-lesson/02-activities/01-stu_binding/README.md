# Activity: Angular Binding

## Instructions:

For this activity, start by using the to-do list application code that you have from the previous class.

Test out property binding and event binding by doing the following:

* Change the Toggle Display button to be a mouseover event instead of click
* Create an image with a dynamic `src` tag through property binding
