# Activity: Angular Delete

## Instructions:

Using the code that you have so far for your To-D list application, complete the following tasks:

1. Create a new button that displays an "X" or "Delete" and add a click event to trigger a method called `onDeleteTask(i)`. Be sure to refactor your code such that each list item will have a delete button.

1. Then, create an `onDeleteTask(i)` method that splices the `tasks` array to remove the item at a given index.
