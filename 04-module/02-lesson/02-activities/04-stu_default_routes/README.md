# Activity: Default Routes

## Instructions:

1. Inside of `app-routing.module.ts`, create a path to ``, that redirects to `items`, and ensure that you also set pathMatch to `full`.

1. Generate a new component, page-not-found, and create a new path to `**` that redirects to `PageNotFoundComponent`.

Hint: Don't forget to import components!
