# Activity: Generate Architecture Components with CLI

## Instructions:

* Using the above chart, scaffold the application's key pieces: `AdminComponent`, `NavbarComponent`, `ItemsMasterComponent`, `ItemCardComponent`, `ItemDetailComponent`, `CheckoutComponent`, then the `CartService`, `ItemsService`, and `TransactionsService`

* This is only the basic component generation; no need to start working on the HTML/SCSS/TS just yet.

* Ensure **all** is done via the CLI (or a VS Code Extension like [Angular Files](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexiv.vscode-angular2-files)). There's really no reason *not* to use the CLI for how much time it saves and its ease-of-use.
